Question 1
Using networkx, load up the directed multigraph from email_network.txt. Make sure the node names are strings.
This function should return a directed multigraph networkx graph.

Question 2
How many employees and emails are represented in the graph from Question 1?

This function should return a tuple (#employees, #emails).

'''
Question 3
Part 1. Assume that information in this company can only be exchanged through email.

When an employee sends an email to another employee, a communication channel has been created, allowing the sender to provide information to the receiver, but not vice versa.

Based on the emails sent in the data, is it possible for information to go from every employee to every other employee?

Part 2. Now assume that a communication channel established by an email allows information to be exchanged both ways.

Based on the emails sent in the data, is it possible for information to go from every employee to every other employee?

This function should return a tuple of bools (part1, part2).

Question 6
Using the NetworkX function strongly_connected_component_subgraphs, find the subgraph of nodes in a largest strongly connected component. Call this graph G_sc.

'''
Question 11
Which node in G_sc is connected to the most other nodes by a shortest path of length equal to the diameter of G_sc?

How many nodes are connected to this node?

This function should return a tuple (name of node, number of satisfied connected nodes).
