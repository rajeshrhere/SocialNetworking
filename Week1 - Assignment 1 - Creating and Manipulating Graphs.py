Question 2
Using the graph from the previous question, add nodes attributes named 'type' where movies have the value 'movie' and employees have the value 'employee' and return that graph.

Question 3
Find a weighted projection of the graph from answer_two which tells us how many movies different pairs of employees have in common.

Question 4
Suppose you'd like to find out if people that have a high relationship score also like the same types of movies.

Find the Pearson correlation ( using DataFrame.corr() ) between employee relationship scores and the number of movies they have in common. If two employees have no movies in common it should be treated as a 0, not a missing value, and should be included in the correlation calculation.

This function should return a float.
